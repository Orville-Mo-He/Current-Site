        <h2>Client:</h2>
        <p>Our client is a global technology company that designs and manufactures automotive
            components and systems for a range of vehicle types, including hybrid and electric vehicles. Driven by its
            commitment to making transportation safer, more sustainable, and more connected, our client is also at the
            forefront of the development of autonomous driving technology and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS),
            with aims to expand research on driving in non-highway settings, including understanding the transition from
            highway to non-highway driving, how users perceive the automation, and when they choose to engage/ disengage
            the automation.

        <h2>Project Goal:</h2>
        <p>This project aims to research driver behaviors and the use of partial automation on highway and
            non-highway roads and the transitions between these driving environments. To distinguish assisted
            driving experiences from the experience of driving as a whole, this project will be split into two
            phases:

    <div class="">
        <h3>Research Goals</h3>
        <div>
            <p>For this phase, to better focus our research, we centered our efforts around the following questions:
            </p>
            <ol class="" start="1">
                <li class="big-1"> How do user needs and motivations affect their transportation preferences and needs?
                </li>
                <li class="big-1"> What are the differences in driving experience between highway
                    and non‑highway environments;
                    and how do these differences affect driver behavior across environments?
                </li>
                <li class="big-1">What are the factors that affect the desirability and usage of ADAS features?
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

<div>
    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <div class="grid-1-1">
        <div class="no_t_m_children">
            <p>To orient ourselves in the ADAS problem space and to gain a detailed understanding of the Tesla Model 3
                (our client-selected benchmark) and its features, our group started with a round of secondary research
                (on ADAS) and interaction mapping all of the Model 3’s ADAS related features.
                <br><br>
                We then furthered our understanding and contextualized our insight within the larger space of automation
                within the Mobility industry through a comparative competitor analysis that covered 10 competitors (2x
                each of direct, partial, indirect, parallel, and analogous competitors).
                <br><br>
                Finally, to better understand driver needs and motivations, the differences between driving in highway
                and non-highway environments, and the use of ADAS features, we conducted a round of five interviews with
                drivers with at least 2 years of experience using ADAS.

            <p>To humanize our findings and contextualize driver needs, motivations, and frustrations; we created a set

        <div class="grid-item">
            <h4>Overarching Insight</h4>
            <p>Drivers currently only use ADAS features if they are in low-complexity environments and when the
                quality-of-life improvements that ADAS features bring to that driver outweighs the the added attention
                and energy it requires from drivers and the percieved risk in using autonomous driving features.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                <ol class="" start="1">
                    <li>Drivers do not currently trust autopilot systems, and, as a result, using autopilot features
                        becomes more taxing because drivers feel the need to pay more attention when using autopilot
                        features because drivers need to be already aware of the situation on the road if failures
                        happen in order to react in time.
                    </li>
                    <li>Drivers that don’t fully trust autopilot systems will only use autopilot features under
                        conditions that they believe to be perfect (long strips of low traffic highways in good
                        weather)
                    </li>
                    <li>Due to current levels of trust, ADAS usage is mostly seen on longer trips rather than daily
                        commutes, minimizing its benefits, namely making space for drivers to relax and providing
                        convenience for tedious tasks.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <h4>Recommendations</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Provide drivers with feedback when the complexity of their driving environment increases so users
                    know when they need to pay more attention, create an internal monitor of the system's certainty of
                    its evaluation of the driving environment, and let users know when that certainty drops below a
                    certain threshold. <p>
                        This would, ideally, eliminate the added attention draw that drivers face when using autopilot
                        features <bold>in complex environments or when transitioning into complex environments.</bold>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Focus efforts on fixing ghost-braking and other failures that are not directly caused by
                    environmental complexity. <p>
                        This aims at eliminating the added attention draw that drivers face when using autopilot
                        features <bold>in less complex environments due to not knowing when such events might occur.
                        </bold>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a log of all events and decisions that the system makes and encounters, categorize and
                    distill this into a log of events that the driver can review and understand. <p>
                        This would allow drivers to more easily understand when, where, and why errors or failures might
                        occur in the future, thereby, improving driver confidence and trust in the system under
                        conditions where the system would not fail.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Embrace regulation—especially when it comes to automation and safety. Well-regulated fields have
                    less tolerance for risk, more standardized risk factors, and better and wider consensus on the
                    perception of risk. Embracing regulation, decreases perceived risk and thereby increases willingness
                    to purchase, test, and use automated products with high associated risk. Early proponents of
                    regulation in lesser regulated fields are also often publicly perceived as safer than competitors.

    <h2>2. What's the current user experience?</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Research Goal and Methodology</h3>
    <p> To understand how the interface designs of autonomous vehicles affect the use of ADAS features and to gain
        insight into how to better design interfaces of autonomous vehicles, our team analyzed the interface of the
        Tesla Model 3 by conducting a heuristic analysis and a user test targeting the features and functions that were
        found to be highly relevant to building user’s trust towards the system during our user interviews. We selected
        the Model 3 as our ADAS benchmark to match our phase 1 benchmark and because Model 3 is a relative affordability
        model with an extremely high market share within the EV segment.
    </p>
    <h3>Overarching Insights</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <bold>Ambiguity or lack of clarity in the design of the interface</bold>, such as the lack of visual
                differentiation between Tesla’s “Autosteer” and “Navigate on Autopilot” modes [Heuristic Issue 4],
                <bold>can induce user errors and confusion, such as believing that the system is failing when the system
                    is actually functioning as intended</bold>. This can lead to decreased trust in the system as well
                as decreased willingness to test and use autonomous features.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Lack of interface clarity and unintuitive design for features and actions outside of the autonomous
                system (such as adjusting mirrors, turning the car on/off, checking range, and opening windows) can lead
                to extraneous heuristic strain in learning the system.
            </p>
            <p>This extraneous learning strain diverts attention away from familiarization with the autonomous
                system/features and can also lead to a general sense of confusion, which can, in turn, lead to more
                misunderstandings and errors.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>These insights highlight the importance of designing clear and intuitive interfaces in the effort towards
        widespread use and demand for autonomous driving systems and features.
    </p>
    <div>
        <h3>Heuristic Analysis</h3>
        <p>In the heuristics evaluation, five team members each took turns taking the roles of one notetaker, one
            videographer, one driver, and three examiners. A Tesla Model 3 with a basic Tesla Autopilot software
            platform was rented for four hours for the evaluation and driven on a predetermined route from Ann Arbor to
            Kent, Michigan to include both highway and urban driving scenarios to meet our research needs. The data was
            collected during the driving with video clips and notes. The individual evaluation was the first step of
            this heuristic evaluation, in which each team member examined the system individually from the data
            collected based on the 10 heuristics principles. The findings from the individual evaluation were aggregated
            to a shared Google Sheet file for further analysis including debriefing the usability issues based on the 10
            principles, in-team discussion for the debriefing, and assigning priorities and severities for the issues
            based on the 0-4 rating of the heuristic evaluation. In this study, the rating of the usability heuristics
            issues was decided on the level of affecting users’ ability to drive, driving performance, and safety.

        <h3>Usability Test</h3>
        <p>This usability test aims to understand how new drivers interact and understand Tesla’s unique user
            interface through a straightforward onboarding experience. This study incorporates five participants with no
            or little experience with Tesla to perform six tasks simulating everyday driving scenarios using a
            stationary Model 3. The tasks tested the common features of daily driving scenarios on the car display and
            were followed by usability interviews to gather feedback on the ease of completing tasks, any issues
            encountered, and overall impressions of the car display.

                            Key Issue 1, leads to confusion about how to adjust mirrors and check tire pressure.</p>
