                    The Learning Experience Design Graduate(LxD) Certificate Program, offered through Center of Academic
                    Innovation (CAI) provides students with the theoretical understanding and real-world experience

                    to design holistic student-centered learning experiences across modalities of instruction.

                    <h4>Implement mentorship system</h4>
                    <p>The implementation of a mentorship program aims at improving and encouraging student engagement
                        by
                        providing students with much needed support, by circumventing communication inefficiencies, and
                        by
                        simplifying the coordination process.</p>

                    <p>
                        By working with mentors, students have a place to go to elicit help for difficulties they are
                        experiencing at an individual level—areas might not be well covered-by or suited- for seminar.
                        This
                        includes the refinement of their personal processes and methodology towards designing learning
                        experiences and the deliverables that this entails, however, this can also include working on
                        developing
                        the “intangibles”: the soft-skills required to be a successful learning experience designer and
                        the
                        navigation of the ambiguity and openness inherent to this field of work.

                                    projects,
                                    students experienced difficulties navigating the ambiguity inherent to the designing
                                    of
                                    learning

                        <p>
                            This lead me to look for a holistic solution that would better support students

                    <p>
                        The current program-coordination process and student-project management process, is almost
                        entirely
                        done
                        by hand. Due to the programs rapid expansion and continued projected expansion, this model is no
                        longer
                        sustainable, and it is therefore essential to redistribute responsibilities and automate or
                        simplify
                        (cull) redundant processes and tasks.

                    <p>
                        The management of the program is focused on the growth, development, and maturation of the
                        program.
                        This, however, was seen as synonymous with providing a well designed learning and teaching
                        experience
                        for students and LxDs respectively, leading to misdirected efforts. To better engage students in
                        their
                        learning and support LxDs in their training of students, it is vital to realign the program’s
                        focus
                        onto
                        the experience of the students and LxDs.

                    <h4>Using Google Calendar to visualize student-project mapping</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to account for the interests and background of the students, the program conducts the
                        pairing
                        of students to LxDes projects by hand. There is, however, no set process or designated artefacts
                        to
                        help, which has resulted in a highly inefficient, inconsistent, and “chaotic” process.</p>

                    <p>
                        Since a large portion of the pairing process is in the balancing of schedules, the utilization
                        and
                        “hacking” of Google’s Calendar provides a short-term (not scalable) fix that streamlines and
                        automates
                        much of the process.

                    Altogether, our team held three separate brainstorming sessions that were split between individual
                    and
                    group brainstorming, during which ideas would often be combined into proto-solutions.

                <p class="red_callout">
                    After we had generated 50 proto-solutions, we compiled them into a spreadsheet and rated and ranked
                    each
                    based on its ease-of-implementation, the importance of problem(s) it aimed address, and the
                    likely extent to which it solves these problems.

<p>The project brief and initial client meet indicated that the focus streamlining the workflow, rather than student
    engagement, and, if I had the chance, I would go back and interview more students. </p>
<h4>Full</h4>
<p>The project brief and initial client meeting was heavily focused on the coordination process rather than student
    engagement. There was also only one student listed as available for interview. As a result, our team believed the
    focus to be the workflow of the coordination process, and thus focused our research efforts on that. It was only
    after the interview with one of the program’s associate directors did the centrality of student engagement become
    clarified.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the single interview with the student hadn’t occurred yet and the interviews with the learning experience
    designers had revealed several of the tensions and pain points of both students and the learning experience
    designers. The interview with the student thus allowed for an informal evaluation of frustrations identified thus
    far, while also providing a different frame of reference for those points of frustration.</p>
<p>
    <b>That being said, if this project was extended, it would be absolutely necessary to conduct more interviews with
    the students and with a focus on their experiences and the contributing factors.</b>

        <h3 class="reflections">Team Dynamics </h3>
        <p> A brief would bring misunderstandings, so here’s what I learned instead: (And I will write more casually
            here.)
        </p>
        <ol class="red_callout">
            <li>I learned how to maintain team productivity and communication despite poor team dynamics.</li>
            <li>I learned that, while it’s good that I have the ability to build strong interpersonal relations with any
                individual
                team member, I also need to learn how to utilize this to help teammates connect with each other.</li>
        </ol>


        <h3 class="reflections">Full</h3>
        <p>I was the designated editor, graphic designer, and point person for client outreach, I was the one that
            polished
            and
            finalized everything. This meant that everything had to go through me because I was the one who polished and
            finalized everything before sending it out.</p>

        <p>
            During the beginning of the project, one member of the team (X) was largely self taught and, consequently,
            initially,
            held positions that were outside of professional practice (such as supporting the use of priming questions).
            <br><br>
            <b>To be absolutely clear and fair, X was and is a great person, they were just misapplying a few principles
                sometimes. X also made the necessary adjustments very quickly.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            X, however, expressed to me on the side that they felt somewhat excluded and not-trusted, (and this was very
            much not the case)
            so I brought it up with the other teammates that we should try to include X a little more. But the efforts
            seemed to
            put X on gaurd more than anything, which eventually strained the overall team dynamics, and, gradually
            shifted
            the team
            dynamic to something more like rotating teams of two.
        </p>

        <div class="red_callout">
            <p>
                In order to ensure deliverables made all the deadlines
                and without loss of quality, I really had to utilize my role as the person that finalized everything to
                connect and
                work with each team member individually. I also had to really lean into my individual relationship and
                rapport with each
                member to keep the project on track and keep the communication consistent. Thankfully, everything held
                through the very
                end, and the team ultimately delivered a great final presentation and report to both the class and the
                client.
                <br><br>
                Looking back, if I could repeat, I would definitely much more emphasis into building the team dynamic
                rather
                than
                holding things together by working with teammates individually. This isn’t to say that this new approach
                is
                definitively better, especially when given the circumstances and my personal bandwidth, but I think that
                it’s
                important to learn how to help teammates connect with each other.
